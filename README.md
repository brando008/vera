# Vera: A Virtual Audience

## What does it do
In this case it's just a static frontend, but imagine a world where you can test an ad campaign before it even reaches the audience.  
Our application would take in an ad and then test it out on a set of virtual audience members who might click or not click, depending on if the ad targeted them. We would return key characteristic features of the bots and percentages of who clicked and who didn't.  
This lets the customer save on time, money, and energy before fully releasing an ad.

## Tech/Framework
We only used React.js for the framework and TypeScript as the language.
